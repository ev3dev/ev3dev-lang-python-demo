# EDUCATOR
These demonstration scripts are for the EDUCATOR robot that can be built using
the Education kit (45544). You can also build a close approximation using the
Home kit (31313) if you purchase some additional parts such as a gyro sensor and
ultrasonic sensor. You can substitute the ball and socket from the Education
kit with a single rear wheel.
