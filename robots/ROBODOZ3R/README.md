Control ROBODOZ3R as follows:

- ROBODOZ3R starts with the User-Controlled Mode. You can switch between the User-Controlled Mode and the Autonomous Mode by pressing the Touch Sensor.

- User-Controlled Mode:

    - Drive ROBODOZ3R around according to instructions from Channel 1 of the IR Remote Control:
        - 2 Top/Up Buttons together: drive forward
        - 2 Bottom/Down Buttons together: drive backward
        - Top-Left/Red-Up and Bottom-Right/Blue-Down together: turn left on the spot
        - Top-Right/Blue-Up and Bottom-Left/Red-Down together: turn right on the spot
        - Top-Left/Red-Up: turn left forward
        - Top-Right/Blue-Up: turn right forward
        - Bottom-Left/Red-Down: turn left backward

    - Use Channel 4 of the IR Remote Control to make ROBODOZ3R raise the shovel by pressing either Up button, or lower the shovel by pressing either Down button

- Autonomous Mode: ROBODOZ3R drives around on his own to clean up small things but avoids big obstacles by reversing and turning
