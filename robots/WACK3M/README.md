# WACK3M

> Designed by Martyn Boogaarts
> 
> This is an arcade-style game that tests your reaction speed. The robot pops up disks that you have to whack as quickly as possible using the wack-wheel hammer. Challenge your friends and see who wackedy-wacks the fastest!

The build instructions may be found at the official LEGO MINDSTROMS site [here](https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/set/assets/bltdb2f687cb4aa5b97/WACK3M.pdf)

How to play: Press the Touch Sensor to start a game. Each game has ten rounds of whacking, and your average response time is measured.
